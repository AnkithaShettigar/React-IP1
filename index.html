<h3>1.What is Virtual DOM</h3>
<p>React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.</p>
<h3>2.What is SPA</h3>
<p>A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that is designed to be displayed as a single, static page.Makes the application more user-friendly and easier to navigate, as users can see the entire application at once.</p>
<p>They consist of a single web page that loads all content using JavaScript. They request the markup and data independently and render pages straight to the browser. Single-page applications are web pages that only require a single HTML page to load.A single-page application comprises HTML and JavaScript, usually including a server-side language (such as PHP) that processes data and returns the results.</p>
<p> SPAs are easier to develop and maintain than traditional web applications. Developers only need to build a single HTML file for the SPA. No server-side changes are necessary.</p>
<p>You can reuse the same JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code for multiple pages, and there are tools that allow developers to package these components into reusable modules.</p>
<p>SPAs make it easier to secure web pages, because they can be protected by a firewall or require login credentials.</p>
<h3>3.What is difference between class and functional component</h3>
<p>Functional component</p>
<p>1.A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).</p>
<p>2.There is no render method used in functional components.</p>
<p>3.Functional component run from top to bottom and once the function is returned it cant be kept alive.</p>
<p>4.Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, that they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.</p>
<p>5.React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot be used in functional components.</p>
<p>6.Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them Stateful.

   <pre> 
    example: const [name,SetName]= React.useState(' '')
   </pre>
</p>
<p>7.Constructors are not used.</p>
<p>Class component</p>
<p>1.A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.</p>
<p>2.It must have the render() method returning JSX (which is syntactically similar to HTML)</p>
<p>3.Class component is instantiated and different life cycle method is kept alive and being run and invoked depending on phase of class component.</p>
<p>4.Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.</p>
<p>5.React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).</p>
<p>6.It requires different syntax inside a class component to implement hooks.
 <pre>
    example: constructor(props) {
    
        super(props);
     
        this.state = {name: ' '}
     
     }
 </pre>
 </p>
 <p>7.	Constructor are used as it needs to store state. </p>
 <h3>4.What do you mean by state and its use in react?</h3>
 <p>React components has a built-in state object.The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.When the state object changes, the component re-renders.</p>
 <pre>
    class Car extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = {
            color: "red",
            year: 1964
          };
        }
        render() {
          return (
              <p>
                It is a {this.state.color}
                from {this.state.year}.
              </p>
          );
        }
      }
 </pre>
 <h3>5.What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?</h3>
 <p>JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.</p>
 <p>JSX makes it easier to write or add HTML in React. JSX can easily convert HTML tags to react elements. It is faster than regular JavaScript. </p>
 <h3>6.What is package.json</h3>
 <p>This is a JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) file that includes key information concerning your project. This is a required file that is needed to run any React project. This file includes metadata such as name , author and version as well as starter scripts and dependencies used in the project</p>
